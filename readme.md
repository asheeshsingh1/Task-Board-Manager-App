## Meta Info
* Currently the apps supports simple interaction of user with boards and task on boards
* Later every time when a user creates a board we create Document in the MongoDB collection and same is being done for a task.
* So from tasks collection, we will be able to fetch:

<ol>
    <li>All the tasks created by the user</li>
    <li>Particular created by the user</li>
</ol>

* Instead of storing plain password in database, we can store hashed password using bcryptjs library of JS. While authenticating the user we can simple match the hashed password with the password stored in DB.
* We can also add a default page for requests that does not map for any url.
